# Kidousity Chatbot
The idea is to specifically tailor the chatbot to satiate the intellectual curiosity of 6â€“10 year old kids. They will be able to ask questions in the text form and get short, crisp, and accurate answers to their questions in the form of text again. It will help kids in interactive learning and maintaining the curious nature of questioning. Using our chatbot, the kids can get answers to as many questions as they want and get quick responses.
